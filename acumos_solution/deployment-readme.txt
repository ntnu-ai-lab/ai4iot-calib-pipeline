                    Documentation of Deployment of Kubernetes Client

The downloaded solution.zip folder contain one directory named microservices which contain .proto file 
corresponding container of a composite pipeline. Main directory contain dockerinfo.json file which is used for orchestration. 
This folder contain a kubernetes-client-script.py file which is responsible for all the deployments and it also create one extra 
service for each node of a pipeline “named_webui” for web interface. This python script first find the free ports and then assign 
as a node-port to each service then update the node port in dockerinfo.json file. 

Step 1: 
Extract the downloaded solution.zip folder. 

Step 2:
Make sure python yaml is installed.
You might use

    pip install -r requirements.txt

to install necessary requirements for kubernetes deployment script and orchestrator client.

Step 3:
Now run the python script kubernetes-client-script.py. You have to provide namespace as parameter to the script.

Step 4:
You need to verify that deployments and services are deployed successfully. 

    kubectl -n <namespace> get all

After running this command on terminal, you have to take a look that corresponding pods are running successfully in given namespace.

Moreover in the next versions we are considering the persistance volume and also resource limitations. 
Security stuff also taken into account.
